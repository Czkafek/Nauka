Find index of:  8

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 10 11    at first we search the middle of an array so 
                            mid = Math.round(array.length / 2;)
                            mid = 6
                        is 8 bigger or smaller than 6?
                            it is bigger
                            so we are searching in bigger half
    
    7 8 9 10 11           so mid = 6 and we have to find second mid, how do we do it?
                        mid + rest / 2 = 6 + rest / 2
                        mid = 9     9 = 6 + rest/2
                                    rest/2 = 3
                                    rest = 6
                        mid where = 6, so we practicly have done mid + mid/2
                        okay so mid = 9 and lets check,
                            is 8 bigger than 9? no. Then we choose smaller half
        
        7 8 9               so mid = 9, we have to find second mid, how do we do it?
                        lets try the formula from the previous example, will it work?
                        mid = mid + mid/2, so mid = 9 + 9/2
                                              mid = 9 + 5
                                              mid = 14
                        as we can see, the result is not right, we need a second
                        formula for a situation, when we chose the smaller half,
                        half on the left.

                        mid = prev.mid + rest       by prev.mid I just want to mark
                        mid = 8                     that it is previous mid
                        8 = 9 + rest
                        rest = -1
                        how to get this -1 we can change formula so it is
                        8 = 9 - rest
                        so rest = 1, and we will have substraction not addition
                        we make it by doing smth like this

                        Math.floor(rest/2);   where we assume that rest = 3, but now
                                              we have to get this 3 somehow
                        
                        full array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], 11 elemnts
                        11 - 9 = 2, okay, even better, now we can just do

                        Math.round(rest/2);  where rest = array.length - mid,
                        so the formula we get:

                        Math.round((array.length - mid) / 2);

                        Okay so we have both formulas
                        
                        lets try this, I will write them now in the second fil
                        so we have acces to them all time


Lets try with the same array but different number to find:

Number to find:  5

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11     at first we always search the middle of the array, so
                            mid = Math.round(array.length/2) = 11/2 = 6
